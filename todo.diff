+ coastline: shapefile base
+ coastline: shapefile parallel
+ coastline: fix coastline on tiles with features

+ db: store gzipped tiles
+ db: auto clean database
+ db: feature packing duplicates the used database on disk!
+ db: feature packs in extra file for fine grained memory management
- db: variant (+types) for metadata

+ import: shared strings during second pass
+ import: parallelize
- import: dont prepare fully seaside
- import: fragmentation management for planet file
- import: prepare tiles with empty database?!
- import: shared_metadata and feature inserter flush in other thread
- import: count broken geometries (missing nodes)
- import: create pack index only if there are enough features in an entry

- misc: proper feature wraparound 180/-180 <-> artifacts on island?!
- misc: some tiles mising on lower z for full coastlines
- misc: improve geometry clipping: compute unclipped z-range
- misc: update conf library

+ render: metadata completed zoom levels
+ render: fast bounding box check in deserialize (same as zoomlevel)
+ render: bugs whole tile -> blue with roads and rail (z8 brandenburg)
+ render: iterate -> zoom level 0: 2tiles?!
+ render: iterate -> coastline: south america missing?!
+ render: fix get_tile bottleneck: iteration/skip is slower than rendering (z>=11)
+ render: use clipper for geometry clipping
- render: combine seaside on higer z levels
- render: order shapes by area
- render: skip simplify for simple features (polygon with 4 points -> binary)
- render: deduplicate features on higher zoom levels
- render: merge nearby shapes with equal properties

+ perf: improve performance
+ perf: database disk usage statistics
+ perf: compact feature storage: 4kb pages of lmdb lead to bad memory efficiency
- perf: import europe
- perf: import planetfile
- perf: custom arena/block allocator for geometry stuff
- perf: compress tiles with https://github.com/ebiggers/libdeflate/blob/master/libdeflate.h
